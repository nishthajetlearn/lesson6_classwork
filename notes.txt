Multiple plots on the same graph
>>start with mutiple line plots and scatter plots on teh same space 

>> continue with bar charts by showing how could you draw the multiple bars in teh same space and do easy comparision

Introduce to histogram, stack plot, pie chart, scatter plot

Introduce to sub-plotting
>> example to demonstrate how subplots could be used

Explanation of the Code
Multiple Line and Scatter Plots: This example shows how to create multiple line and scatter plots on the same graph to compare different functions.
Bar Charts: This code demonstrates how to create grouped bar charts for easy comparison of two datasets.
Histograms: The histogram example shows the distribution of random data, which can be useful for understanding data frequency.
Stacked Plot: The stacked bar chart illustrates how to visualize different series in the same category.
Pie Chart: This code creates a pie chart to show the proportional representation of different categories.
Subplots: The final example demonstrates how to create multiple plots in a single figure using subplots, which is useful for comparing different types of visualizations side by side.


to run the code :
pip install numpy matplotlib
